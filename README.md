# Discourse client 

A discourse client consuming REST services built with an MVVM architecture 
and coordinators to manage transitions between view controllers. 
The UI was built programmatically. 
Table view with self-sizing dynamic cells.
Note the delete button works but the API does not fully delete the topic 
until a given period of time, I still reloaded the table.
